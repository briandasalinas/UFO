# UFO
## Overview of Project
We helped our friend Dana create a website to filter through the massive amount of data for UFO sightings. 

## Results
We created a filter table that users can use to track different UFO sightings. Below is the filter table you will be able to find on the lower left hand corner of our website.

All users have to do is fill in any of the filters and the data will then filter itself out!


## Summary

This website is very user friendly! The only drawback in this website is that the comments cut off after certain characters. I'd recommend Dana to add a 'Contact Me' section on her website so users can send more data or share any thoughts on the data they're reading. I would also trade in for a drop down menu for the filters to let the user know which filters are available.
